    <p>If we look at the history of City Palace Jaipur, it was established in the year 1729-1732 under the reign of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh in Jaipur. Before that, the King used to work in the town of Amer, and the massive Amber Fort was his place for administration and home to his royal family. 
    However, due to increased population and water scarcity, Maharaja Jai Singh decided to build a new complex and capital for his administrative work. The City Palace Jaipur came into existence, and he founded Jaipur.
    The City Palace Jaipur India’s design was made by the famous Bengali architect Vidyadhar Bhattacharya and a Britisher named Samuel Swinton Jacob. Another interesting fact about Jaipur is that it is called “Pink City.” Maharaja Jai Singh decided to impress the Prince of Wales, King Edward VII, by colouring the city of Jaipur in pink. Today, the City Palace Jaipur is home to the last ruling royal family, who live on the Palace’s private property.</p>
